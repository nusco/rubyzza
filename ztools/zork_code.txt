extremely fragile."

inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer
is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the
north end of the room is through huge marble pillars."
S121: "This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears
to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into
darkness. You probably could not get back up it."
S122: "You haven't a prayer of getting the coffin down there."
S123: "This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring the
dam. There are open doorways here to the north and east marked "Private", and
there is a path leading south over the top of the dam."
S124: "This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood Control
Dam #3. Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of the
valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a group of buttons
colored blue, yellow, brown, and red. There are doorways to the west and
south."
S125: "You are at the base of Flood Control Dam #3, which looms above you and
to the north. The river Frigid is flowing by here. Along the river are the
White Cliffs which seem to form giant walls stretching from north to south
along the shores of the river as it winds its way downstream."
S126: "You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the Dam. The river flows
quietly here. There is a landing on the west shore."
S127: "You cannot go upstream due to strong currents."
S128: "The White Cliffs prevent your landing here."
S129: "The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the Dam. The
White Cliffs loom on the east bank and large rocks prevent landing on the
west."
S130: "There is no safe landing spot here."
S131: "Just in time you steer away from the rocks."
S132: "The river descends here into a valley. There is a narrow beach on the
west shore below the cliffs. In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard."
S133: "You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
White Cliffs. There is a narrow path heading south along the Cliffs and a tight
passage leading west into the cliffs themselves."
S134: "The path is too narrow."
S135: "You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the Cliffs. A narrow
path leads north along the shore."
S136: "The river is running faster here and the sound ahead appears to be that
of rushing water. On the east shore is a sandy beach. A small area of beach can
also be seen below the cliffs on the west shore."
S137: "You can land either to the east or the west."
S138: "The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here. On the east shore
is a large landing area."
S139: "You are on the east shore of the river. The water here seems somewhat
treacherous. A path travels from north to south here, the south end quickly
turning around a sharp corner."
S140: "You are on a large sandy beach on the east shore of the river, which is
flowing quickly by. A path runs beside the river to the south here, and a
passage is partially buried in sand to the northeast."
S141: "This is a sand-filled cave whose exit is to the southwest."
S142: "It's a long way..."
S143: "You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk on a
rainbow), with a magnificent view of the Falls. The rainbow travels east-west
here."
S144: "You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs.
The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow
crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the
southwest."
S145: "You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable
here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the
north is a narrow path."
S146: "You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You
can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage
which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above
you is more cliff, which appears climbable."
S147: "You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there
is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.
Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of
the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north,
Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows
out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense
forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to
climb down into the canyon from here."
S148: "Nice view, lousy place to jump."
S149: "You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal mine.
The shaft enters the west wall, and there is another exit on the south end of
the room."
S150: "You are in a small room. Strange squeaky sounds may be heard coming from
the passage at the north end. You may also escape to the east."
S151: "This is a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft descending
through the floor into darkness below. To the west and the north are exits from
this room. Constructed over the top of the shaft is a metal framework to which
a heavy iron chain is attached."
S152: "You wouldn't fit and would die if you could."
S153: "This is a small non-descript room. However, from the direction of a
small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected. To the south is a
narrow tunnel."
S154: "This is a small room which smells strongly of coal gas. There is a short
climb up some stairs and a narrow tunnel leading east."
S155: "This is a very small room. In the corner is a rickety wooden ladder,
leading downward. It might be safe to descend. There is also a staircase
leading upward."
S156: "This is a rather wide room. On one side is the bottom of a narrow wooden
ladder. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room."
S157: "You have come to a dead end in the mine."
S158: "This is a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
timbers. A wide passage comes from the east and turns at the west end of the
room into a very narrow passageway. From the west comes a strong draft."
S159: "You cannot fit through this passage with that load."
S160: "This is a small drafty room in which is the bottom of a long shaft. To
the south is a passageway and to the east a very narrow passage. In the shaft
can be seen a heavy iron chain."
S161: "This is a non-descript part of a coal mine."
S162: "This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal mine.
On the south wall of the chamber the letters "Granite Wall" are etched in the
rock. To the east is a long passage, and there is a steep metal slide twisting
downward. To the north is a small opening."
